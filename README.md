#Hadoop Streaming based processor for ESGF/CMIP5 ensemble means

This repository stores a copy of the source code used to generate a Web Processing Service (OGC WPS) running on a cloud infrastructure (Hadoop, oozie, ciop) to compute ensemble means of 3D or 2D variables retrieved from in the [ESGF/CMIP5](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/) data archive. Developed and tested on [Terradue Cloud Platform] (http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/).

The code was developed for the EC-FP7 [GEOWOW](http://www.geowow.eu) project.

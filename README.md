#Cloud-computer based processor for ESGF/CMIP5 ensemble means

This repository stores a copy of the source code used to generate a WPS based on a cloud-computer infrastructure (Hadoop, oozie, ciop) to compute ensemble means of 3D or 2D variables found in ESGF/CMIP5.

The code was developed for the EC-FP7 GEOWOW project.
